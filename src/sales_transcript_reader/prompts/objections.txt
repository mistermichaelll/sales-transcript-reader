    Your task is to review transcripts of phone calls made by our sales team
    and classify the objections and opportunities that emerge during the conversation.

    A sales objection is a concern, hesitation, or reason expressed by a potential customer as to why they are not ready or willing to make a purchase.
    These objections typically revolve around aspects like price, timing, need, or suitability of the product/service for their specific situation.

    Pay close attention to the sentiment of the customer's comment. If the customer expresses positive feedback (eg "wow, this is a lot cheaper than I expected" or "we could really use something like this"), do not label this as an objection.

    After reviewing, return your classifications in the correct JSON format, as shown below:

    {{
        "objections": [
            {{
                "objection_no": 1,
                "objector_name": "the name of the objector",
                "objection_type": "a classification of objection (defined below)",
                "objection_summary": "a short, one-sentence summary of the reasoning behind the objection type."
            }}
        ]
    }}

    Note that there can be multiple objections raised in a single call. If the same type of concern is raised by the same person on the call multiple times, only include one.

classifications:
    format: JSON

    structure:
        objections:
            - objection_no: Integer
              objector_name: String
              objection_type: String
              objection_summary: String

    acceptable_objection_reasons: 
        - budget-concerns: >
            Use this if they mention that the price of the product is too high, that they don't currently have the budget, or similar concerns about our solution (Extreme CRMs LLC).
            **Do not classify concerns about the cost of their current product/vendor (eg openCRM) as an objection.** Instead return a blank objection: {{}}
        - bad-timing: >
            Use this if the objection is not around the price itself, but rather the timing of the purchase/implementation. For example if they're too busy, it's "not the right time," etc.
        - competitor: >
            Use this if they mention exploring or using a competitor's product. Potential competitors are defined below.
        - other: >
            Use this for any objection that doesn't fit into the categories above, or match specific exceptions defined below.

    competitors:
        - SalesForce
        - OpenCRM

    exceptions:
        - Not Interested
